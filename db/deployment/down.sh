# $0 is argument 0, which is always the script path

# This changes the directory to the directory containing the script
cd "${0%/*}" || exit
# This ensures all env variables are exported so env variables used in .env.db (like $HOME) are properly expanded when the
# env files are consumed by e.g. docker compose
set -a
# Load environment variables from .env.deploy file
. .env.deploy

# -v ensures volumes are removed (but files are persisted)
docker compose down -v
