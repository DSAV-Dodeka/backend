    This is a complex query. What it does, in essence, is collect all the events related to a specific classification_id
    and (in the `class_events` table) add up all the points that each person have over all events in that
    classification. Their point totals for that classification are then updated in the `class_points` table, so they
    can be more easily queried. Furthermore, if `publish` is True, display_points will also include the events after
    the hidden date. See below for more details on the query itself.

        set_display = "new_points_hidden"

    # The outer query is a simple upsert query. We INSERT INTO `class_points` and ON_CONFLICT, we update the true
    # points and display points. We access this from the special `excluded` table, which is the row you are trying to
    # insert but that is conflicting.

    # The first nested query is a simple SELECT that adds ensures the row we insert into `class_points` has the right
    # columns. We again add te `:id` param to the row. If `publish` is true, we set the fourth column also equal to
    # `new_points_hidden`, otherwise we set it `new_points`, which only includes points from events before the hidden
    # date.

    # The second nested query is where the magic happens. It FULL JOINs two nested SELECT statements. Let's discuss the
    # first SELECT. It selects the event_id, user_id and the hidden_points and vis_points. We added columns whether an
    # event is hidden or not and multiply that with the points to get zero or the correct/hidden points. These come
    # from the JOIN of the class_event_points with the events, where we modified the events by joining it with the
    # classification table to separate hidden from non-hidden events. This is also necessary as only the class_events
    # contains the class_id, from which we only take the event_id's that are of the correct class_id.

    # The second nested select takes all user_id's that are listed to be 'active'. The FULL JOIN means that if there are
    # rows that do not match (so if there is an active user with no associated events), it will be added with null for
    # the missing column (so null for event_id and points). We now have a table with multiple events per person,
    # some people with null events and null points. To get the total amount of points per person, we aggregate using
    # the SUM function, and use GROUP BY user_id since we want to take those together. We use the COALESCE(points, 0)
    # to ensure that null values are turned into zeros. The result is a table with only one occurrence of a user_id
    # and that person's points, which is then used by the outermost queries as described above.
